/**
 * Root ESLint flat config — this is where the boundary laws get TEETH.
 * `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` turns "no upward import" from a review
 * convention into a lint error, using each project's `type:*` tag.
 *
 *   type:lib     → may depend on:  lib
 *   type:service → may depend on:  lib, service
 *   type:app     → may depend on:  lib, service   (NOT other apps)
 *   type:package → may depend on:  lib            (a distributable you SHIP)
 *
 * `type:package` (packages/*) is the 4th bucket: what you ship to third parties
 * (npm SDKs, embeddable widgets, CLIs). It may depend on libs only — and it's
 * TERMINAL: no app/service/lib/package lists `type:package` in its allowed tags,
 * so nothing internal can import a package. Shipped out, not consumed within.
 *
 * Tags live in each package.json under `nx.tags`. Deep imports past a lib's public
 * door (`@zippy/db/src/...`) are also blocked here (banTransitiveDependencies keeps
 * the barrel file the contract).
 *
 * DIVISION OF LABOR (see docs/linting.md): Oxlint does the bulk of linting (fast, Rust).
 * ESLint is kept ONLY for `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` — the one rule Oxlint has no
 * equivalent for. The `eslint-plugin-oxlint` spread below reads `.oxlintrc.json` and turns
 * OFF every ESLint rule Oxlint already covers, so ESLint stops double-reporting. It must be
 * LAST so its "off" wins over the Nx presets above; it does not touch enforce-module-boundaries.
